dclike.panel             A function to compute the value of the log
                         likelihood for a given set of panel data and a
                         given value of the parameters.
eddcmp                   Eigenvalue--eigenvector decomposition.
kldata                   Simulated panel data from "The analysis of panel
                         data under a Markov assumption"
panel                    A function to compute the maximum likelihood
                         estimates of the transition parameters from
                         panel data.
